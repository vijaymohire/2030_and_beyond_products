# 2030_and_beyond_products
Based on 2030 Technologies, we have made special products that will find their use for very niche industries and hi tech projects. These are based on advanced technologies  related to quantum and AI technologies.

For example, we have various prototypes and demo toy models that allow users to ue our publicly available code and frameworks to extend and develop their own products. We can offer our expertise in your product design and development.

Based on classified taxonomy, develop governance framework that uses cobit, coso, ITIL, Services Iso, services cmm, for use by various Cloud users, corporate staff, investigators, forensic team, analyst, data scientist, allowing them to work on personal data, corporate data, business data, enterprise financial payrolls, allowing staff to build custom pipelines, for Supercomputer that uses all types of functional cross domain details, generates maps, links, relationship, that offers all types of financial transactions and who benefited, who lost opportunity being eligible and why. 

Using Technology to design domain solutions unlike state of the art technology, how , apply AR and deep domain expertise to harness the AR based technique to leverage technical features to design domain solutions in resolving prevailing issues in that domain that can disrupt market,generate value and drive economy.

Few key steps:

Structure the business units based on domains and base them with various Technology base models that will be extend to meet domain requirements and fine tune.

Have a Cmdb with all these domains and technology base focused on QAI under various capacities from mobile based computing ,laptop, edge, server and Supercomputer. Start with Excel sheet and move that to a Cmdb. 

Once domain needs and technology base is identified, solutions to domain needs are developed. 

Also add state of art issues related to domains, projects, real world issues, and these needs are to be addressed by unique technology and scientific solutions.

Use a simple Gui to interface these db with gui for admin and use as Master DB and Admin. 

Solution Cafe is good for getting services related to your products or leverages on existing products. However, you need to build these domain products that solve problems or improves on the state of the art. 

Products can be any IT assets, models, tangible products that can be handed to client for operations in their domain.
