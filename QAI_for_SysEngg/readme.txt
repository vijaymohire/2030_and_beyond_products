QAI for SysEngg are the tools, products, Tech Readiness Assessments( TRA), processess that allow for the design and approval of newer products or modernisation of products, especially for the Hi Tech Industry that needs better and more innovative performance improved responses from systems based on NASAs TRL levels and DoD standards  

Key merits of QAI for Sys Engg.:
1) Reduced time to market by way of optimising, automating the entire life cycle, processess by data driven and hi speed computing in arriving facts, data and metrics 
2) Speed of Oprations by using our startups 16+ Ops frameworks( like Prod. Ops, Operations Research Ops) that can help in various new /novel items, features to be introduced and can span from concept to lab, design development and production environments
3) Dynamic Business transformation layers within our Org frameworks allwing for agile sprints, sprint backlogs, Program Manager role maping to various agile staff member roles that speed up the concept adoption and realising within the alternative and actual environments
4) Use of simulations, digital twins, 3D printed material, Programmable matter , dynamically reconfigurable circuits, swithces,network elements making room for highly flexible and dynamic design and development environments
5) Traceability using market products like Rational DOORS, Jaama, for requirements, traceability and compliance management   
6) Flexible Quality frame works that can be tailored to meet various manufacturing standards like MIL-HDBK-896A Manufacturing Management guides, DoD MRL Deskbook, AS6500, ISO 9001 etc
7) Ready to use QAI product concepts that can help accelerate your QAI product journey in areas of QAI Processor, QAI Datacenter, QAI IT Hub, etc 
8) QAI Trained Engineers who are good at Industrial Management in terms of industrial product integrations, operations management, IIoT, IT/OT systems, cyber security, and various Govt and Enterprise Architectures like NASA SE, DoD Acquistion, FedRAMP, INCOSE SE, TOGAF, etc
